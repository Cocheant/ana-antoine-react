Website for our wedding 
by Antoine Cochet "Cocheant"

The purpose of this website is to make a nice wedding invitation, as well as a great way to give information to the people who want to come. 
The website must be in all three languages we have: ES, EN, FR. 

The information we want to display: 
  Section about us with a timeline and some photos, 
  Details on the wedding itself: ceremony, party, guest info like languages, photos, etc..
  Travel information and what to see there
  Accomodation
  

We also want a RSVP system that will automatically go into a sheet with the number of people coming, food allergies/intolerances, maybe comments, and songs suggestions.
